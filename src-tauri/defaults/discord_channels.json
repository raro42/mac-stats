  "_doc": "Discord channel listen modes for mac-stats. Modes: mention_only = respond only to @mentions and DMs (default), all_messages = respond to every human message (bots ignored), having_fun = respond to everyone including other bots (loop-protected). Channels support a simple string format or an object with 'mode' and optional 'prompt' to shape response style. having_fun timeframes (response_delay_secs_min/max, idle_thought_secs_min/max) are in seconds; max_consecutive_bot_replies (default 0) caps bot-to-bot replies to avoid self-talk. Timeframe values each use picks a random value in that range (e.g. 300–3600 = 5–60 min).",

React to what others say, share thoughts, joke around, be curious."
